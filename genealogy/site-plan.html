      Family history is a the best way to bring your loved ones together as you celebrate and explore your common roots. 

    <h3>My website aims to promote family history in the high Andean</h3>
    <dt>Regions that in the past were part of the Inca Empire and pre-Hispanic cultures in Peru and to unite families descending from the Incas and families from the highland ethnic groups in order to organize a great family tree will come to my web site because there is no other family reunion sites in my country, especially focused on families descended from the Inca Empire population of the Cusco and surrounding regions. The Inca nobility was a privileged and exclusive group in the Inca Empire, however, the descendants who did not obtain those privileges are counted by many and my website seeks to identify the extended families that share Inca ancestors. <dt></dt>There are very few websites that have experience with Peru-specific registries, especially Catholic Church registries, and it should be understood that Hispanic parishes were not only the principal units of ecclesiastical organization, but also the main social unit for much of the rural life. in Hispanic countries</dt>
    <h3>My website will have content to answer the following questions:</h3>

<dt>What is the origin of my last name and how am I connected with the family lines of Peruvian ancestors?</dt>
<dt>How to do genealogical research in the Andean countries and where find records digitized and indexed in FamilySearch, such as civil and parish genealogical records of Cusco and surroundings?</dt>
The family tree of the main known Inca descendant families and their genealogies
<h3>Here are some engaging activities and family reunion ideas </h3>You can use to fill your gatherings with family history fun!
<dt>Reunion is word that is fundamentally about renewing connection and relationships with those who are important to us</dt>
<dt>The activities that users will complete are in FamilySearch https://www.familysearch.org/discovery/activities/?cid=bl-fsup-8438</dt>
<dt>Everything about me? FamilySearch website where users will find interesting facts related to the date of their birth.</dt>
</dt>Share photos and stories, in order to rescue the stories of the native inhabitants of the Andean region, where there were many genealogical records written in the past
Write, or record, your family member's story on FamilySearch (with his or her permission). Then capture your experience. In the future, reading or listening to your story again will help you. It will also help those that follow you. This point is very important because it is very difficult to find written genealogies of pre-Hispanic peoples, however a combination of oral genealogy and parish records dating back to 1500 can help - through these experiences - to build the past of these peoples.
Stories (from FamilySearch) where they will be encouraged to write oral genealogical histories and old photographs to rescue the history of the past.
<dt>Ask a parent or family member about a time that he or she or someone in the family turned a weakness into a strength.</dt>
<h3>This information is necessary to complete any actions on my site,</h3>
The purpose is to share information collaboratively, for that his information is necessary to complete any actions on my site,
Each user will be required to share something about their ancestors, tips or a genealogy of a specific family, etc. that will help others in their research.
Users are required to create an account in FamilySearch in order to access all resources published. 
<h3>Visitors will come to my website because </h3>There is no other dedicated to local genealogies in Peru and neighboring countries.
Because of how easy it is to connect to a genealogy that has already been researched by others.
Will include memories, photos, stories, activities, pedigree chart and links to other genealogical resources as FamilySearch.
